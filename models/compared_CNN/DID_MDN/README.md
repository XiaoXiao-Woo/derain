We present a novel density-aware multi-stream densely connected convolutional neural
network-based algorithm, called DID-MDN, for joint rain density estimation and de-raining. The proposed method
enables the network itself to automatically determine the rain-density information and then efficiently remove the
corresponding rain-streaks guided by the estimated rain-density label. To better characterize rain-streaks with dif-
ferent scales and shapes, a multi-stream densely connected de-raining network is proposed which efficiently leverages
features from different scales. Furthermore, a new dataset containing images with rain-density labels is created and
used to train the proposed density-aware network.

## Reproduce

To reproduce the quantitative results shown in the paper, please save both generated and target using python demo.py  into the .png format and then test using offline tool such as the PNSR and SSIM measurement in Python or Matlab.   In addition, please use netG.train() for testing since the batch for training is 1.
